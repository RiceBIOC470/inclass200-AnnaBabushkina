%In this folder you will find a .mat file with x and y data

% For all of the questions below, use any options as necessary to get a
% good fit - starting points, lower bounds etc. 

% 1. Define a custom model and try to fit the data to a Michaelis function 
% y = V*x/(K+x). 
% 2. Use a custom model to try to fit the data to a Hill function with
% exponent 2: y = V*x^2/(K^2+x^2)
% 3. Now treat the exponent as a free parameter and perform the fit again,
% that is fit to the model y = V*x^n/(K^n+x^n)
% 4. Redo parts 1 and 2, but using your model from 3 and fixing the value of
% n to either 1 or 2.
